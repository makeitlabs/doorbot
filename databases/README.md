# ACL Database

You must create a `curlpw` file to contain the credentials to fetch the ACL.  It contains one line in the following format:

`machine auth.server.com login apiname password apipassword`

Replace `apiname` and `apipassword` with valid login credentials for the auth backend.

# MQTT Listener

You must create a `~/ssl` folder that contains the following valid, generated certificates/keys:

- `ca.crt` - Self-signed (usually) CA cert for the MQTT broker
- `client.crt` - A client cert generated for this node, usually CN=mac addr
- `client.key` - Private key for this node

Presently the keys are generated by deployment tools in the RATT project.
